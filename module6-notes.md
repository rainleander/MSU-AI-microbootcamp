- **Important Note for Apple M1 Chip Users**:
  - Do not install TensorFlow and Keras directly if using an Apple computer with an M1 Chip.
  - Refer to the "Apple M1 Chip Users" section for alternative instructions.

- **Installing TensorFlow**:
  - TensorFlow 2.0 dependencies should be present in the default Conda environment.
  - Activate the Conda environment and install TensorFlow using `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`.
  - Verify TensorFlow installation by checking the version (`python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"`).

- **Installing and Verifying Keras**:
  - Keras is included with TensorFlow 2.0.
  - Verify Keras installation (`python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"`).

- **Troubleshooting Installation Issues**:
  - If you have any problems, please refer to the [TensorFlow Install Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).
  - Google Colab is an alternative platform that supports TensorFlow and can run Jupyter Notebook files.

- **Using Google Colab for Apple M1 Chip Users**:
  - Use Google Colab to run module activities.
  - Upload activity notebook files to Google Colab and run the code as usual.
