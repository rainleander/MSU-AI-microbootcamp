## Module 4: Supervised Learning — Classification
### Classification Overview
4.1.1: Classification Overview  
**Introduction to Supervised Learning:**
- Learning the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Two types of models based on the nature of predicted outputs (continuous or discrete).

**Linear Regression for Continuous Values:**
- Linear regression is used to predict continuous values.
- Continuous values can be divided into smaller quantities.

**Classification Models for Discrete Values:**
- Classification models are used for predicting discrete values.
- Discrete values are finite and cannot be subdivided.

**Introduction to Logistic Regression:**
- Logistic regression is a classification model for predicting binary discrete values.
- Examples of binary outcomes include spam detection in emails.

**Considerations for Model Selection:**
- Besides known output type, other factors for model selection include data size and complexity.
- Addressing complexity includes methods like linear and non-linear data handling, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and ensemble learning.

**Applications of Classification:**
- Organizations use classification models in various fields, including finance, insurance, health, and risk assessment.
- Different approaches to classification, including logistic regression, SVMs, and decision trees, will be discussed in the module.

This text provides an overview of supervised learning, focusing on linear regression for continuous values and introducing the concept of classification models for discrete values, particularly logistic regression. It also mentions considerations for model selection and real-world applications of classification models.

4.1.2: Getting Started  
**Files to Download:**
- Download module files from "Module 4 Demo and Activity Files."

**Required Installations:**
- Install the following packages:
  - Scikit-learn for building classification models.
  - PyDotPlus for visualizing decision trees.

**Install Scikit-learn:**
- Activate your dev virtual environment using "conda activate dev."
- Check for existing Scikit-learn installation with "conda show scikit-learn."
  - If installed, no further action is needed.
  - If not installed, follow the official Scikit-learn documentation for installation.

**Install PyDotPlus:**
- Ensure the dev virtual environment is active.
- Install PyDotPlus using "conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus."
- Verify the installation with "conda list pydotplus."

**Note:**
- PyDotPlus is required for the Decision Tree demonstration.
- If you encounter issues with PyDotPlus installation, consider using Google Colab or attending office hours for the demonstration.
