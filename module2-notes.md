## Module 2: Unsupervised Learning
[Module 2 Notes](module2-notes.md)
### Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
2.1.1: What is Unsupervised Learning?  
- **Comparison with Supervised Learning**:
  - Two primary methods of machine learning are unsupervised and supervised learning.
  - Unlike supervised learning that utilizes labeled data, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data.

- **Process & Use**:
  - Unsupervised learning identifies trends, relationships, and patterns (clusters) within data.
  - Its applications:
    1. Cluster/group data to discern patterns rather than predicting a class.
    2. Transform data for intuitive analysis or for use in supervised/deep learning.

- **Practical Applications**:
  - Recommending related products based on customer views.
  - Targeting specific customer groups in marketing.
  - Use cases include customer segmentation, fraud detection, outlier identification, spam detection, healthcare diagnoses, and sentiment analysis.

- **Challenges**:
  - No definitive means to verify the correctness of the output.
  - Understanding the clusters is challenging, as the algorithm self-generates categories.

- **Interplay with Other Learning Methods**:
  - Unsupervised learning can be used alongside supervised learning, deep learning, and NLP.
  - Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can optimize predictions or classifications by reducing input variables.
  - It can serve as a pre-training step before applying deep learning on labeled data.
  - In NLP, unsupervised learning can group texts/documents based on similarity.

- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - By the module's end, learners will be able to:
    1. Understand unsupervised learning's role in AI.
    2. Define clustering in the context of machine learning.
    3. Utilize the K-means algorithm for clustering.
    4. Determine the optimal cluster number using the elbow method.
    5. Convert categorical variables to numerical representations.
    6. Understand and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
    7. Utilize K-means post-PCA for improved data analysis.
