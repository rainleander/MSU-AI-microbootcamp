## Module 3: Supervised Learning — Linear Regression
### Supervised Learning Overview
3.1.1: Introduction to Supervised Learning  
- Overview of Machine Learning Categories:
  - Unsupervised Learning:
    - Used for knowledge discovery and clustering.
    - Examples include news feed recommendations based on online habits.
  - Supervised Learning:
    - Used to predict outcomes based on trained data.
    - Examples include spam detection and weather forecasting.

- Introduction to Supervised Learning:
  - Supervised learning involves learning from data and known outcomes.
  - It entails feeding the model with examples and correct answers.
  - The model is trained to minimize prediction errors.
  - Useful for predicting numerical values or recognizing predetermined categories.

- Practical Example of Supervised Learning:
  - Categorizing fruit based on labeled data for training.
  - Application in predicting high-risk vs. low-risk loans using historical data.

- Key Learnings in the Module:
  - Understanding the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Learning key concepts of supervised learning.
  - Determining the appropriateness of regression or classification models.
  - Applying the model-fit-predict process.
  - Making predictions with linear regression models in supervised learning.

3.1.2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning  
- Distinction between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:
  - Common Aspects:
    - Both use data and algorithms.
  - Differences:
    - Supervised Learning:
      - Requires clear answers for predictions.
      - Utilizes labeled information.
      - Involves high human intervention and expertise.
    - Unsupervised Learning:
      - Limited human intervention.
      - Works with unstructured, unlabeled data.
      - Focuses on finding patterns.

- Visualization of Data:
  - Supervised Learning:
    - Uses classification models to label data on graphs.
  - Unsupervised Learning:
    - Isolates patterns using clustering models on graphs.

- Key Differences Summarized:
  - Human Intervention:
    - Supervised: High
    - Unsupervised: Limited
  - Data Type:
    - Supervised: Labeled
    - Unsupervised: Unlabeled
  - Tools:
    - Supervised: Linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines
    - Unsupervised: Clustering and dimensionality reduction
  - Models:
    - Supervised: Regression and classification
    - Unsupervised: Clustering and association
  - Action:
    - Supervised: Training model with known results to update parameters.
    - Unsupervised: Segmenting data into groups or reducing data dimensionality.
  - Goal:
    - Supervised: Forecasting and predicting predefined outputs.
    - Unsupervised: Finding hidden patterns in data.
  - Results:
    - Supervised: Metrics reflecting the model’s ability to generalize data.
    - Unsupervised: Exploratory results identifying groups or anomalies.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Supervised: Requires labeled data; risk of overfitting or underfitting.
    - Unsupervised: May yield non-meaningful results; results are subjective.

- Module Focus:
  - Previous Module: Using clustering and association in unsupervised learning.
  - Current Module: Key concepts of supervised learning and their application to forecast and predict continuous values with regression models.
  - Next Module: Application of supervised learning concepts to discrete values using classification models.
