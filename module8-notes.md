## Module 8: Emerging Topics in AI
### Introduction to Emerging Topics in AI
8.1.1: Introduction  
- The course's final module focuses on cutting-edge AI research areas and technologies.
- It provides a high-level overview of key concepts in AI rather than technical details.
- AI is evolving rapidly, impacting various fields and industries.
- Examples of AI applications include generative systems in art, AI-generated music and entertainment content, medical Q&A, legal AI bots, industrial monitoring systems, and more.
- Pre-trained transformers significantly drive innovation in AI, including computer vision and large language models.
- The module covers areas of active research in AI, such as one-shot algorithms, speed improvement, mobile deployment, and more.
- The rapid evolution of AI technology raises both potential benefits and challenges.
- Ethical and regulatory concerns about AI in the legal industry are discussed.

8.1.2: Getting Started  
- The module focuses on fundamental concepts related to emerging AI topics.
- No new software installation or usage is required for this module.

### AI the Creator
8.2.1: Introduction  
- Previous modules covered transformers and their applications in generative AI.
- Transformers are potent models that process data, learn from it, and make predictions or generate content using self-attention.
- Generative AI utilizes transformers to interpret text instructions and create various output types.
- Transformer technology can generate text, images, music, or code.

8.2.2: Interactive Text Generation  
- ChatGPT is a sophisticated natural language processing model based on GPT-4.
- It can suggest income tax deductions and performs well on various tasks.
- ChatGPT is trained using reinforcement learning with three steps: supervised fine-tuning, mimicking human preferences, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
- This reinforcement learning strategy improves the naturalness of ChatGPT's responses.
- Google's Bard focuses on recognizing inaccurate information and may admit limitations.
- Microsoft's Copilot is integrated into its Office suite for various text-related tasks.

8.2.3: Image Generation  
Generative AI for Images:
- Image-generating AI systems like Stable Diffusion use deep learning techniques.
- They map textual descriptions to images or parts of images.
- They interpret user prompts describing desired images and create matching images.

Role of Noise in Image Generation:
- Noise refers to random pixels that disturb images.
- Image generation models recognize and predict how to clear up noisy images.
- The training process involves adding noise to an image and predicting the original image from the noisy version.
- Image generation in reverse: a noisy image is generated based on text descriptors, and the model clarifies it.

Efficiency in Image Generation:
- Image generation is computationally demanding but can be optimized.
- Stable Diffusion compresses images to smaller sizes for diffusion and reverse diffusion processes.
- This optimization reduces the computational resources required.

Other Image Generators:
- DALL-E 2 by OpenAI generates images based on text prompts using contrastive learning.
- Artbreeder allows users to manipulate images with sliders to create original artwork.
- DeepArt.io recreates user images in the styles of art movements like Pop Art or Impressionism.

8.2.4: Music Generation  
AI in Music Generation:
- Music generators use complex transformers to associate prompts with sound data qualities.
- Transformers can analyze existing music data and categorize it based on labels from user prompts.
- This process identifies styles, genres, keys, transitions, tempos, and other musical elements.
- Producers can describe their desired song to the algorithm to create a customized piece.

Example: Aimi:
- Music-generating model Aimi can create a new sound file that producers can modify without composing or recording from scratch.

8.2.5: Problems and Possibilities  
Issues with Generative AI Training Data:
- Generative AI models require large datasets for training.
- Lack of transparency regarding the data used for training.
- Concerns about using copyrighted works for training without proper compensation.

Example: Stable Diffusion and Getty Images:
- Stable Diffusion models were accused of generating images based on copyrighted work, leading to a lawsuit involving Getty Images.

Challenges in AI Training:
- Lawsuits related to AI models trained on public data repositories like GitHub's Copilot.
- Creators of publicly available works do not anticipate their intellectual property being used by AI.

Opportunities in Content Creation:
- Generative models offer opportunities for speeding up content production.
- Potential for innovative and experimental content creation.
- Chaining together multiple AI components for complex tasks without additional user direction.
