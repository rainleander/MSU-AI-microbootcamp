- Transformers can analyze existing music data and categorize it based on labels from user prompts.
- This process identifies styles, genres, keys, transitions, tempos, and other musical elements.
- Producers can describe their desired song to the algorithm to create a customized piece.

Example: Aimi:
- Music-generating model Aimi can create a new sound file that producers can modify without composing or recording from scratch.

8.2.5: Problems and Possibilities  
Issues with Generative AI Training Data:
- Generative AI models require large datasets for training.
